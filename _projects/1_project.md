Premature mortality in Serbia is a problem that is often overlooked. 

The goal fo this reserch project  was to quantify the premature mortality in Serbia. 
Researching both the total premature mortality, as well as the mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and PM2.5 air pollution. 

In this individual research project I use detailed mortality (vital statistics based) data which I then combined  with remote sensing data of PM2.5 to estimate how affected are the municipalities of Serbia by air pollution. 

Results show that Serbia loses over half a million years of potential life per year. Premature mortality due to PM2.5 air pollution is most prominent in municipalities of Vojvodina (North Banat). Results indicate that the initial year of pandemic does not paint a full picture when it comes to premature mortality caused by COVID-19. The paper offers recommendations in the form of a needed paradigm shift when it comes to population policy (instead of a pronatalist one â€“ to one that focuses on improvement of public health as a population policy), revision of strategic documents, focus on prevention and opening data as a cheap way to encourage research, inform and educate the public.

In this project I also looked into the cost of the pandemic in 2020 to premature deaths in Serbia. In 2020 alone, 64620 years of potential life were lost directly by COVID-19, i.e., 1019.14 years of potential life per 100.000 people younger than 75. Men lost 2.5 as many potential years of life then women did. Moreover, the region of eastern and Southern Serbia fared much worse than any other region.  In 2020 more than $0.34 billion was lost to premature deaths, and by the end of 2021, this number will likely be well over $1 billion when the pandemic ends.
