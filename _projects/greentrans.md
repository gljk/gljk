This project aims to examine the public's views in Serbia regarding their support for alternative energy sources in general. Also, the goal of the project is to investigate whether in Serbia the NIMBY aspect makes a difference in these attitudes, that is, whether the public in Serbia views alternative energy differently if the construction of new capacities is planned in their immediate surroundings.

The research project is being conducted in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-budi%C4%87-559624219" target="_blank">Marina Budić</a>


Research Findings

Our findings indicate a strong preference among the Serbian public for renewable energy sources, notably solar and wind. Interestingly, these preferences do not correlate significantly with nationalist views, a pattern that sets Serbia apart from trends observed in Western Europe. Despite Serbia’s geopolitical ties with Russia, these factors appear to have minimal impact on the public’s energy preferences, which are more influenced by local and environmental considerations than international politics.

Policy Implications

The data suggests a strategic opportunity for policymakers to prioritize renewable energy development, moving away from nuclear energy and minimizing further coal and small hydropower (SHP) projects. This approach aligns with the broad public consensus and supports Serbia's potential EU accession, facilitating a shift in both energy and foreign policy landscapes.


Publications

Our research findings have been detailed in a reaserch paper and policy paper shedding light on the public opinion and policy implications in Serbia's energy sector.
