This project aims to examine the public's views in Serbia regarding their support for alternative energy sources in general. Also, the goal of the project is to investigate whether in Serbia the NIMBY aspect makes a difference in these attitudes, that is, whether the public in Serbia views alternative energy differently if the construction of new capacities is planned in their immediate surroundings.

The reserch project is being conducted in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-budi%C4%87-559624219" target="_blank">Marina Budić</a>
