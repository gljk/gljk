The clearest example of successful interventions to lower the mortality is the one which took place in a province of Finland called North Karelia between 1972 and 1977. A big campaign, with goal to lower the cardiovascular disease risk factors, mobilized not only the healthcare system, but also different multiple agents such as: schools, supermarkets, agriculture, civil society organizations, etc. Campaign proved to be very successful and was quickly expanded to include the entire country. The mortality by ischemic heart disease of those younger than 65 years in North Karelia was lowered by 73\% between 1972 and 1995. Which parallels can be drawn from the mortality situations of Serbia today and Finland then? This paper identifies the causes of death that can be avoided where mortality rates are still very high in Serbia and identifies possible directions of measures geared toward lowering mortality.},

COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in 2020 in many countries (according to the preliminary data).By applying the demographic method to final mortality data for 2020, we can give an overview of the situation in Serbia through population mortality indicators.The effect of COVID-19 on mortality in Serbia in 2020 was higher than anticipated. The surplus of mortality that occurred in 2020 (compared to the three-year average of 2017-2019) is 14,657, an increase in mortality of about 14\%. Deaths from COVID-19, according to vital statistics, make up 71\% of excess mortality. This increase is also reflected in life expectancy at birth which dropped by 1.55 years. The male population observed higher mortality rates from COVID-19 and a more significant life expectancy drop. Around 4\% of those who died from COVID-19 are younger than 50. A person who is 85 or older was almost 100 times more likely to die from the consequences of COVID-19 than a person who is 34 or younger. COVID-19 was the second leading cause of death in Serbia in 2020. One of the few positive things about this pandemic is that violent deaths plummeted.},

	abstract = {The present chapter focuses on fertility and mortality problems as the two big demographic challenges facing Serbia. The trend of the average number of live births to women who were past the reproductive age in 2011, considered by age cohorts, indicates an early below-replacement fertility and a long period in which the number of live births per woman was stable at the value of 1.8. Although younger cohorts have yet to age beyond their reproductive years, markedly lower average number of live births by women aged between 36 and 40 compared to women aged 41 and over in 2011 will probably deepen due to completed fertility declining below the 1.8 mark. At the same time, Serbia is struggling with high premature mortality. Premature deaths of middle-aged people, but also younger, reproductively capable people, have effect on the economy, childbearing, and depopulation. In Serbia, men are dying more prematurely than women. About half of all deaths of men younger than 75 in 2015 could have been avoided by either prevention or adequate and timely healthcare. Big urban centres are much better off in this regard, unlike more remote regions which often lack good healthcare services.},

	abstract = {Serbia is experiencing a massive number of deaths due to COVID-19. One way to express this mortality is by measuring the years of potential life lost to this disease. This paper looks at the cost of the pandemic in 2020 to premature deaths in Serbia. The final data on mortality in 2020 in Serbia provided by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia is used to measure this loss. Premature mortality is examined through geographical, age, and sex dimensions. In total, 64.620 years of potential life were lost directly by COVID-19, i.e., 1019.14 years of potential life per 100 000 people younger than 75. Men lost 2.5 as many potential years of life then women did. Moreover, the region of eastern and Southern Serbia fared much worse than any other region. There is no clear pattern regarding the rural/urban divide, as some of the hardest-hit municipalities were rural and urban. The analysis was expanded to include the estimate of the economic cost of premature mortality due to the COVID-19. In 2020 more than \$0.34 billion was lost to premature deaths, and by the end of 2021, this number will likely be well over \$1 billion when the pandemic ends. The direct cost of premature deaths on future birth rates will not be pronounced as very few women younger than 50 died to affect future birth rates significantly.},

	abstract = {The 2020 pandemic came at a huge demographic cost, particularly regarding the increase in mortality. In this paper we examine excess deaths in Serbia and 34 other European countries in 2020. Methodological inconsistencies and big differences in how COVID-19 deaths were recorded across different countries make it difficult to make any cross-country comparisons, even with the scope limited only to Europe. Since the number of total deaths is a methodologically solid indicator, we looked at the differences between the total number of deaths in 2020 and compared that to deaths in 2019. The lowest increase in mortality – below 5\% – occurred in countries in the north of Europe (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Latvia), while the highest increase – over 18\% – was recorded in the southern and central parts of the continent (Albania, Northern Macedonia, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Slovenia, Russia). There is no clear geographical regularity. In 2020, Serbia had 12.6\% more deaths compared to 2019, which was close to the European average. Within Serbia, statistical differences between regions were not large. Measuring the contribution of COVID-19 deaths to excess mortality is much more problematic. The excess death ratio is more helpful for understanding methodological and data-gathering issues than finding evidence about composition and divergence in mortality. According to this indicator (based on preliminary data), only 25\% of excess deaths in Serbia in 2020 were caused by COVID-19, while the European average was 54\%. However, in many (primarily Eastern European) countries in 2020, the indirect consequences of COVID-19 on the health of the population were more significant than the direct ones. It is precisely the ratio of COVID-19 diagnoses that led to death in total mortality that shows this. The final results may confirm this statement or indicate potential data manipulation. While this paper focuses only on the year 2020, as of Q1 of 2021, the pandemic is not nearing its end. Based on preliminary data published daily, Serbia had more COVID-19 deaths in the first four months of 2021 than for the whole of 2020. This indicates that the consequences of the pandemic for Serbia will be dire in 2021, regardless of the course the pandemic takes.},

	title = {People's {Attitudes} {Towards} {Moral} {Bioenhancement}},
	abstract = {The paper represents an empirical study of public attitudes towards moral bioenhancement.
Moral behavior is essential to human society nowadays. The issue of moral enhancement is
important since moral behavior and humanity are, along with rationality, a precious and essential value that constitutes us as human beings. Cognitive and scientific progress allows people to increase their capabilities and use them for both good and bad. Scientific advances offer a possible solution for some forms of the immoral behavior, misbehavior and crimes: moral enhancement of human beings through biomedical and  iotechnological means, provided they are safe and effective. Bioenhancement implies biomedical interventions that are used to improve human form or functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain health. Moral enhancement can be defined as an increase in the moral value of the actions, motives or the character of a moral agent. It implies the improvement of moral dispositions.
 Vigorous debate over the moral propriety of moral enhancement exists, but the views of the
public have been largely absent from the discussion. In this paper we have examined people's attitudes towards moral   bioenhancement. It is important to know public attitudes and the level of the familiarity with this topic. We have carried out a survey in order to obtain quantitative data on public attitudes towards moral bioenhancement. To gain insight into the reasons the public may have for endorsing or eschewing pharmacological moral enhancement, we used empirical tools to explore public attitudes towards these issues. We have examined whether factors like the level of education and familiarity with the topic have impact on public attitudes. Factors that could have impact on people's attitudes towards bioenhancement are inequality, identity change, unnaturalness, restricted freedom, the need for the enhancement, feasibility, efficacy, safety, and the means, some of which we have isolatedin the questionnaire. We were interested in the reasons why people approve or disapprove this form of enhancement. Further, we want to highlight the importance of querying and understanding the public on this issue. Morality at societal level is highly contextual. It is important to examine whether there is a gap between the learned opinion of philosophers and scientists, and the opinion of the general public, because that would suggest that something must change in order for bioenhancement to be useful and effective. One more worry about this issue is whether we engage in a form of social engineering that runs counter to public opinion or not. We have questioned if the familiarity with the topics is one of the reasons why people accept or reject bioenhancement. If
this is the case, scientists and educators should focus on the education of people, especially
young.},
